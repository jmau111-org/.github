## Hi there 👋

* 🙋‍ This org is all about training and sharing tricks, for free.
* 🔌 Meaningful contributions are welcome.
* 💻 There are various Bash/Python/Go scripts for educational purposes, but also personal notes for CTFs and other topics.
* 🍿 Fun facts - the letter "J" can be associated with various meanings. 
* 🧙 You'd rather test experimental scripts and demos in an isolated environment (e.g., a virtual machine).
* ✏️ You can read a few blog posts on [jmau111.github.io](https://jmau111.github.io)
